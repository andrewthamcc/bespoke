## Stack

- React, SCSS (`node-sass` is dead apparently, my app kept crashing for a while)

## Add Ons

- Prettier

## Needs More Info

- I had emailed back asking if there was an API for the data. Without a response I crafted some of my own mock data which also sucked up some time. In the user mock data I assume their last activity is always an array of length three.

- I am also unsure what it means when a member is removed from the list then the member rating algorithm is to be run again. This would require more information to complete this story as there is no calculation for rating at the current.

## Missing

- I couldn't manage the time to add in unit tests. It also didn't help that React was yelling at me for missing a dependency when attempting to run tests.

- Having been very used to working with TypeScript for the last three years PropTypes seem a bit foreign now so I attempted their use then excluded them for times sake.
